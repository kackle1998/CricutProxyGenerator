Step 0: This requires python, numpy, and pillow. In your CMDPrompt or Powershell, run pip install numpy   and   pip install pillow

Step 1: Download the program and keep the attached image within the same folder. 

Step 2: CD into the folder via CMDPrompt or Powershell

Step 3: python MTG_Cricut_AutoArrange.py


Step 4: Add your cards and adjust as needed, generate and print your PDF.

Step 5: Laminate your cards.

Step 6: (only applicable with glossy laminate) The Cricut cannot accurately read the Print then Cut markers as the sensor gets tripped up by the gloss reflection. Somewhat similar to the post-it note trick on the Silhouette, you can use a semi-opaque tape, like Scotch brand, and place it over all 4 Corner Brackets. This dulls the reflection and makes it possible for the Cricut to sense the corners.

Step 7: in the Cricut software, open and run this project.  https://design.cricut.com/landing/project-detail/68d1d3938154bce981a4da11

Step 8: load your sheet and cut. I've found that setting it to custom material "Magnetic Sheet 0.6mm," "More Pressure," and the Fine Point Blade work well. I've done 2 passes per card and they come out perfect.
